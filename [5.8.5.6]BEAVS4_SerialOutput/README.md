# BEAVS 4.0 Serial Output

Dexter Carpenter

The Serial Output script was written with the purpose of supplying sample flight data to the BEAVS microcontroller, and allow it to react using it's own control system. This allows us to observe how the system may react to a flight. A computer running this script will connect via USB to the BEAVS microcontroller and the microcontroller will interpret the serial data as if it was sensing such data with it's sensors.
