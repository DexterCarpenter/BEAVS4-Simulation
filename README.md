# BEAVS 4.0 Simulation
### Dexter Carpenter

This repository hosts MATLAB scripts and data to run a simulation for the Oregon State University's Experimental Sounding Rocket Association Team. The simulation is used to gain understanding of how the Blade Extending Apogee Variance System (BEAVS) will affect the rocket's flight path.

This uses MATLAB R2020b which can be found here: https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/
