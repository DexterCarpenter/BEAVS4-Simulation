# BEAVS 4.0 Simulation 6

Dexter Carpenter

Simulation 6 has been redesigned to be used externally. Specifically for the OSU SCRT's 2025 rocket and BEAVS 5.0.

Simulation has been updated to run in MATLAB R2023a. The simulation prompts to user for inputs and is better documented.

Folders 'Data' and 'Functions' have been added to organize files.
